# Obstacle-Detection-with-Lidar
Detect and avoid obstacles with LIDAR

I used ATMega 2056 with shielding in order to connect components to microcontroller. 

Used Components :

1 - Servo Motor 
  Helps to actuates front wheels in order to change car direction
  
2 - Motor 12V DC 60RPM 25mm
  Main driving motor. Installed in back for rear traction. Polarization is changed in order to rotate forward or backward direction

3 - RPLIDAR A1 LIDAR
  Used in order to detect obstacles
  
4 - Arduino Mega2560 Rev3
  Microcontroller IC board. Serial communication has been established on 9600 baud rate
  
5 - Arduino shied
  Used for easy connection from componenets to board.
